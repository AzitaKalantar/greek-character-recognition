# greek-character-recognition
In this project I used an ancient Greek character dataset to train and 
evaluate different machine learning algorithms. The algorithms I used are 
(Convolutional) Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and K Nearest 
Neighbours. After implementing these algorithms I fed them with pre-processed 
training data and evaluated them on a separate testing data.I also built a GUI program which can select a picture,
detect its characters and predict them before visualising characters and their 
predictions to the user. This GUI could make my program more usable and show 
its outcome and performance better.
